The meaning of this challenge is to validate CSS Grid knowledge and to keep using Flexbox.

## Work Done
- Write the html structure and kind of sketch the layout using:
    ~~~
    grid-template-areas:
    "nav nav nav"
    "aside section section"
    "footer footer footer";
    ~~~
    it made less difficult to assign a reasonable width to the sections.
- Add buttons, i had problems styling it as a button. I used an anchor tag to solve that issue.
- Add media queries for a responsive design, it made sense to use less columns when the device is getting smaller. At the end I even hide the sidebar because it didnÂ´t look good.
- Remove unused img, rename the img, add the respective alt text.     
- Add README.md
